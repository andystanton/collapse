# Collapse

Collapse DOM elements into WebGL representations of their pixels.

## Requirements

* Modern browser.
* Recent node for dependency management.

## Usage

1. `$ npm install`
2. `$ npm start`

An Express app is now running at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) which contains an example page with breakable elements.

## Examples

* [Big Crunch](https://andystanton.github.io/collapse)
* [Windowed Gravity](https://andystanton.github.io/collapse/bits.html)

## Notes

The example in this repository uses Express, but Collapse does not depend on Node at runtime. npm and gulp are used for dependency management and build steps.
